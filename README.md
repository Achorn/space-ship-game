# space-ship-game

A game about exploration and connection.

Using web technologies such as javascript, THREE.js and OO game design principals, I am slowely tinkering away at this pet project of mine.

while I'm using this project for research and development to pivot into game dev, at the heart of it is another art piece where I get to express myself.

A live demo along with other resources detailing journey are linked below
